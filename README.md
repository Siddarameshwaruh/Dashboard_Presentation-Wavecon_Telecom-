# Wavecon Telecom Analysis

This Presentation is done as part of the codebaiscs virtual internship program

## Task :

Analyze the dashboard and provide insights on a ppt that addresses the following questions:

1. What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
2. Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
3. After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?
4. Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
5. Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?

Create a presentation from the dashboard for our telecom client 'wavecon'.

## Insights
1. The revenue has experienced a 0.5% decrease compared to the previous network
2. Despite a 55% increase in unsubscribed users, Pune has shown an impressive 18% growth in active users.
3. Among all the plans, Plan 1, Plan 2, and Plan 11 stand out as the top-performing plans.
4. Following the launch of 5G, Plan 5 and Plan 7 have experienced significant failures, particularly Plan 7, which has witnessed a decline in revenue across almost all cities. It would be advisable to discontinue Plan 7 and proceed with the remaining plans.
5. WaveCon consistently holds the third position in the market without any fluctuations.
